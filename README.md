# SalesforceStuff
A collection of cool Salesforce stuff I have made

User Settings:
A Lightning Web Component that allows end users to create on-demand themes.

Lightning Design System Icons:
A Lightning Web Component that can be used in a sceenflow that allows user to plug directly into the design library. 

Snake in Salesforce:
A Lightning Web Component that, well, allows users to play snake in salesforce. People said it couldn't be done, but to those people I say "beat my high score".
